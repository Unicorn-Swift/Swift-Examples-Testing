# Swift Testing Examples

The folders in this repo all represent a different project, each containing their own unique way of testing. 
Check out the [Unit Test Project](https://github.com/swiftcast/Swift-Examples-Testing/tree/master) for the most basic, and built in way to make tests in Swift. More examples to come, and contributions always welcome.
